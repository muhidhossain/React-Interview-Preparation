## Controlled vs Uncontrolled Inputs

### Controlled Inputs

**Definition:**
A controlled input is an input element whose value is managed by React state.

The value of the input is always determined by the component's state (usually via `useState`).
The `onChange` event updates the state, and the state updates the input's value.

**Key points:**

- React is the single source of truth.
- Makes form behavior predictable.
- Useful when you need validation, formatting, or dynamic updates.

**Example:**

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledInput() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={name} // value comes from state
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} // state updates on change
    />
  );
}
```

### Uncontrolled Inputs

**Definition:**
An uncontrolled input is an input element whose value is managed by the DOM itself, not React.

You read the value only when you need it, usually via a ref.
React does not store the current value in state.

**Key points:**

- The DOM is the source of truth.
- Less code, but less control.
- Useful for quick forms or when migrating legacy code.

**Example:**

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value); // directly read from DOM
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} /> {/* No value in state */}
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Key Differences Table

| Feature         | Controlled                                    | Uncontrolled                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| State location  | React state                                   | DOM                              |
| Value access    | state variable                                | ref or querySelector             |
| Source of truth | React                                         | Browser DOM                      |
| Performance     | May re-render on every keystroke              | Fewer re-renders                 |
| Use cases       | Validation, formatting, conditional rendering | Quick forms, minimal interaction |
| Ease of testing | Easier (all state in React)                   | Slightly harder                  |

**Rule of thumb:**

If you need real-time validation, conditional UI changes, or syncing input with other state, use controlled inputs.

If you just need the value once on submit and donâ€™t care about intermediate changes, uncontrolled is simpler.

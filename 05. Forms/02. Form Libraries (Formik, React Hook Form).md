## Form Libraries (Formik, React Hook Form)

### Why Form Libraries Exist

In React, managing forms without any library means:

- You store each input’s value in `useState`.
- You write `onChange` handlers for each field.
- You manually handle validation, errors, and submission.

For small forms, that’s fine. But for large forms with many fields, validations, dynamic inputs, and performance concerns — that’s where Formik and React Hook Form shine.

### Formik

Formik is one of the most popular form management libraries for React.

**Key Features:**

- Keeps all form state in React state (via hooks internally).
- Provides helpers for:
  - Handling field values (`values`)
  - Handling changes (`handleChange`)
  - Handling validation (`validate` or with Yup schema)
  - Handling submission (`handleSubmit`)
- Works well with controlled components.

**Pros:**

- Easy to learn.
- Works perfectly with Yup for schema-based validation.
- Great for simple to moderately complex forms.

**Cons:**

- Stores everything in React state → Can cause re-renders for every keystroke (not great for very large forms).
- Slightly heavier in performance compared to newer libraries.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Formik, Form, Field, ErrorMessage } from 'formik';
import * as Yup from 'yup';

const SignupForm = () => (
  <Formik
    initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}
    validationSchema={Yup.object({
      email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
      password: Yup.string().min(6, 'Min 6 chars').required('Required'),
    })}
    onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}
  >
    <Form>
      <Field name="email" type="email" />
      <ErrorMessage name="email" />

      <Field name="password" type="password" />
      <ErrorMessage name="password" />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  </Formik>
);
```

### React Hook Form (RHF)

React Hook Form is a newer, performance-focused library.

**Key Features:**

- Uses uncontrolled components by default (fields store their own state in the DOM).
- Minimizes re-renders (form state is tracked with refs).
- Supports both uncontrolled and controlled inputs.
- Great integration with Yup/Zod for schema validation.
- Better for large forms and performance-critical apps.

**Pros:**

- Very fast (doesn’t re-render on every keystroke).
- Smaller bundle size than Formik.
- Works well with complex, nested, and dynamic forms.

**Cons:**

- API can be a little less intuitive for beginners.
- Slightly more setup when working with controlled components like Material UI.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { yupResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/yup';
import * as Yup from 'yup';

const schema = Yup.object({
  email: Yup.string().email('Invalid email').required('Required'),
  password: Yup.string().min(6, 'Min 6 chars').required('Required'),
});

export default function SignupForm() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors },
  } = useForm({
    resolver: yupResolver(schema),
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => console.log(data);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register('email')} />
      <p>{errors.email?.message}</p>

      <input type="password" {...register('password')} />
      <p>{errors.password?.message}</p>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Performance Difference

- **Formik:** Controlled inputs, every change updates React state → more re-renders.
- **React Hook Form:** Uncontrolled by default, stores state in refs → fewer re-renders → faster for big forms.

## Code Reviews

### What They Are

Code reviews are a collaborative process where developers check each other’s code before it’s merged into the main codebase.

The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and catch bugs early.
They foster knowledge sharing and consistent coding standards across the team.

### Why Code Reviews Matter in React Projects

React apps can get complex with component structure, state management, performance optimization, and hooks usage.

Code reviews help catch:

- Incorrect or inefficient use of hooks (like missing dependencies in `useEffect`).
- Unnecessary re-renders due to improper state updates or props.
- Improper component structure or naming that hurts readability.
- Accessibility issues (like missing ARIA attributes).
- Styling inconsistencies or non-reusable UI components.

They also ensure best practices (like splitting large components, proper state management, clean code).

### Key Areas to Focus on in React Code Reviews

1. **Component Design & Structure**

   - Is the component single-responsibility and reusable?
   - Are the props clear, minimal, and well-typed (using PropTypes or TypeScript)?
   - Is there any redundant or duplicated logic?

2. **Hooks Usage**

   - Are hooks used correctly?
   - For example, `useEffect` dependency arrays are complete.
   - Avoid hooks inside conditions or loops.
   - Using custom hooks for reusable logic.

3. **State Management**

   - Is the state well-scoped (local vs global)?
   - No unnecessary state causing extra renders.
   - Proper use of context or external state libraries.

4. **Performance**

   - Memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` where needed.
   - Avoid expensive operations inside render.
   - Lazy loading components or code-splitting where appropriate.

5. **Readability & Maintainability**

   - Clear and meaningful naming.
   - Proper formatting and code style (consistent with linting tools).
   - Comments where logic is non-trivial.

6. **Testing**
   - Are there sufficient tests for new functionality?
   - Does the code make testing easier (e.g., decoupling logic from UI)?

### How to Conduct Effective React Code Reviews

- Be constructive and respectful — focus on the code, not the person.
- Ask questions instead of making demands:
  > “What do you think about extracting this logic into a custom hook?”
- Suggest alternatives with reasons.
- Keep reviews focused and not too long — it’s easier to review smaller PRs.
- Use automated tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript) to catch trivial issues early.

### Example Answer in an Interview

> “In React projects, I consider code reviews essential for maintaining quality and consistency. I focus on reviewing component structure to ensure components are reusable and well-scoped, and verify that hooks are used correctly with proper dependencies to avoid bugs or performance issues. I also check for efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and look for opportunities to memoize or lazy-load components for better performance. Clear naming, code readability, and sufficient test coverage are also critical. When giving feedback, I make sure to be respectful and constructive, often suggesting improvements with reasoning, and encourage small, focused pull requests to make reviews more manageable.”

### How You Can Show Readiness Without Experience

Even if you haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmentored juniors,‚Äù you probably:

- Helped teammates debug or explained React concepts.
- Contributed to documentation for features or workflows.
- Shared tips during code reviews.
- Introduced libraries or patterns in team discussions.

üí° **Example reframe:**
Instead of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never mentored anyone‚Äù, say:

> ‚ÄúWhile I haven‚Äôt had a formal mentoring role, I‚Äôve often guided teammates by explaining React patterns, reviewing code, and walking through debugging steps. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into simpler terms and helping others grow, so I‚Äôm confident I could mentor juniors effectively.‚Äù

### Example ‚ÄúMentoring Juniors‚Äù Answer in Interview

> ‚ÄúEven though I haven‚Äôt had an official mentoring role, I‚Äôve frequently helped teammates understand React best practices, such as proper state management, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, and using reusable components. I like to break complex topics into smaller, practical examples‚Äîlike showing the difference between local and global state with a real feature. I also believe in giving constructive feedback through code reviews and encouraging juniors to research and experiment before I step in, so they develop problem-solving skills.‚Äù

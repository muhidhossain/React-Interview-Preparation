## Making Architectural Decisions

### Understanding the Problem Space

Before choosing an architecture, you need clarity on:

- **Project size & complexity** — Is it a small dashboard or a large multi-team app?
- **Performance needs** — Will it handle heavy real-time updates, or is it mostly static?
- **Team & skillset** — Are they familiar with Redux, TypeScript, or server-side rendering?
- **Long-term maintenance** — Will it evolve for years or be a short-term MVP?

### Core Architectural Considerations

#### a) State Management Strategy

- **Local state:** Use `useState` / `useReducer` for small, isolated state within components.
- **Global state:** Use Context API, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Recoil depending on complexity.
- **Server state:** Use tools like React Query / SWR for caching & syncing with APIs.
- **Decision factor:** Minimize global state; keep state where it’s needed.

💡 **Example:**
For a large e-commerce app, keep cart items in global state (Redux), but product filters as local state in the search component.

#### b) Component Structure & Organization

- **Folder-by-feature (domain-driven)** over folder-by-type for scalability.
- Break into:
  - Presentation components (UI only)
  - Container components (logic & state)
- Atomic Design or similar patterns for reusable UI elements.

💡 **Example:**
Instead of:

```text
components/
	Button.jsx
	Table.jsx
pages/
	Home.jsx
```

Do:

```text
features/
	cart/
		components/
		hooks/
		services/
	product/
		components/
		hooks/
		services/
shared/
	components/
	utils/
```

#### c) Data Fetching & API Integration

- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering):** For dynamic, user-specific data.
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):** For SEO & initial load performance.
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):** For hybrid use cases in Next.js.
- Use service layers or API utilities to avoid API calls inside components.

💡 **Example:**

```js
// services/userService.js
export const getUser = async (id) =>
  fetch(`/api/users/${id}`).then((res) => res.json());
```

#### d) Performance & Scalability

- **Code-splitting:** Use `React.lazy` / dynamic imports to load only what’s needed.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **List virtualization:** `react-window` / `react-virtualized` for large lists.
- Avoid prop-drilling by using context or state management libraries.

#### e) Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests:** Jest + React Testing Library for components & hooks.
- **Integration tests:** Test interactions between components.
- **End-to-end tests:** Cypress / Playwright for user flows.

#### f) Styling Choices

- CSS Modules, TailwindCSS, styled-components, or a design system (Material UI, Chakra UI).
- **Decision based on:**
  - Need for design consistency
  - Theming support
  - Developer familiarity

#### g) Deployment & Build Strategy

- Choose between:
  - Static site hosting (Netlify, Vercel) for SPAs or Next.js SSG.
  - Node-based hosting for SSR apps.
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Example Architectural Decision Process

**Scenario:** Building a scalable SaaS dashboard.

- **State Management:** Use React Query for server state, Zustand for lightweight global state.
- **Folder Structure:** Feature-based modules to scale across multiple teams.
- **Rendering:** SSR for authentication and initial page load, CSR for dashboard data.
- **Performance:** Lazy-load charts, virtualize long tables.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with a shared theme config.
- **Testing:** Unit + integration tests in CI before deployment.

### How to Explain in an Interview

When asked, don’t just list tools—explain why:

> “For this project, I’d choose a feature-based folder structure to keep related logic together. For state, I’d separate server state from UI state—React Query for API data, and Zustand for shared app state—to avoid unnecessary re-fetching. I’d use code-splitting for large components like charts and virtualized lists for better performance. Finally, I’d enforce a testing strategy with Jest for units and Cypress for end-to-end flows.”

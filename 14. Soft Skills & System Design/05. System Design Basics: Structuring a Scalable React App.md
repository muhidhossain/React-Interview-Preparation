## System Design Basics: Structuring a Scalable React App

### Understand Scalability Needs

Scalability means your app can grow (more users, features, developers) without becoming slow or unmanageable.

Plan for modularity, maintainability, performance, and team collaboration from the start.

### Folder Structure & Code Organization

- **Feature-based / domain-driven structure**
  - Organize code by features/modules, not by file types. This keeps related code together and easier to scale.

```text
src/
├── features/
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── userSlice.js
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── hooks/
│       └── api.js
└── shared/
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── utils/
    └── styles/
```

- **Separation of concerns**
  - Keep UI components, business logic, and API calls separate.

---

### Component Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** Components should do one thing well.
- **Reusability:** Create small, reusable components (buttons, inputs).
- **Presentational vs Container Components:**
  - Presentational: UI-only, stateless.
  - Container: Handle state and logic.
- Use hooks to encapsulate reusable logic (`useAuth`, `useFetch`).

---

### State Management

- **Local State:** Use React’s `useState` or `useReducer` inside components for UI-specific states.
- **Global State:** Use Context API, Redux Toolkit, or Zustand for app-wide state (user auth, theme).
- **Server State:** Use React Query or SWR to manage data fetched from APIs efficiently.

---

### Data Fetching Strategy

- Avoid fetching data directly in UI components.
- Centralize API calls in services or hooks.
- Implement caching, pagination, and error handling in data layers.
- Consider SSR or SSG (e.g., with Next.js) for SEO and performance.

---

### Performance Optimization

- Use code-splitting (`React.lazy`, dynamic imports) to reduce initial load.
- Use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Virtualize large lists (`react-window`).
- Avoid prop-drilling by using context or global state.

---

### Styling and Theming

- Use CSS-in-JS (styled-components, Emotion), CSS Modules, or utility-first CSS (Tailwind).
- Implement a design system or component library for consistency.
- Support theming (dark/light modes).

---

### Testing

- Unit test components with React Testing Library.
- Write integration tests for complex workflows.
- Automate tests in CI/CD pipelines.

---

### Build & Deployment

- Use modern bundlers (Webpack, Vite).
- Automate builds, linting, tests, and deployments.
- Use CDNs and caching strategies for fast delivery.

---

### Collaboration & Documentation

- Maintain clear coding standards and guidelines.
- Use code reviews and pair programming.
- Document components, APIs, and architecture decisions.

### Example Interview Answer

> “To design a scalable React app, I start with a feature-based folder structure that groups related components, hooks, and services together for maintainability. I separate presentational and container components to keep UI and logic distinct. For state, I use local state for UI concerns, and Context or Redux Toolkit for global app state, plus React Query for server data. Performance is optimized using code-splitting and memoization. I also ensure styling is consistent with a design system and test coverage is thorough. Finally, I emphasize clear documentation and code reviews to support team collaboration as the app grows.”

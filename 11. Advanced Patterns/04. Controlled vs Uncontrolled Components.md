## Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

### Definition

**Controlled Component**

- A component whose form data is fully controlled by React state.
- The value of the input is set via state.
- Any change triggers an onChange handler to update the state.
- React is the single source of truth.

**Uncontrolled Component**

- A component where form data is handled by the DOM itself.
- You access the value using a ref.
- React does not track every keystroke — the DOM stores it.
- The DOM is the source of truth.

### Controlled Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

**Key points:**

- `value` prop binds input to state.
- `onChange` keeps state in sync with UI.
- Predictable, easy to validate in real time.

### Uncontrolled Example

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Key points:**

- No `value` prop — DOM handles the data.
- `ref` used to get the value when needed.
- Less code, but harder for live validation.

| Feature                    | Controlled                | Uncontrolled          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Data source                | React state               | DOM                   |
| Real-time validation       | ✅ Easy                   | ❌ Manual             |
| Code complexity            | Higher                    | Lower                 |
| Performance on large forms | Slower if not optimized   | Faster                |
| Default values             | value prop                | defaultValue prop     |
| Best for                   | Dynamic forms, validation | Simple one-off inputs |

### Pros & Cons

**Controlled**

- ✅ Full control over UI and data
- ✅ Easy validation & conditional rendering
- ⚠️ More code & re-renders

**Uncontrolled**

- ✅ Less code, faster for static inputs
- ⚠️ Harder validation, less React control

---

### Interview Tip

If asked:

> “Which should I use?”
> Answer:
> Use Controlled when you need real-time validation, dynamic input changes, or conditional rendering.
> Use Uncontrolled for simple, static forms or quick prototypes.
> Also, mention that in large forms, uncontrolled inputs + onSubmit parsing can improve performance.

---

### One-liner Summary

Controlled components keep form data in React state for full control, while uncontrolled components let the DOM handle the data and use refs to access it.

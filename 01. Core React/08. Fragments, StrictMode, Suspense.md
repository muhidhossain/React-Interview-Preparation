# Fragments, StrictMode, Suspense

## Fragments

### Definition:

Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
In JSX, a component can return only one parent element, so if you don't want to wrap everything in an unnecessary `<div>`, you use a Fragment.

### Why use it:

- Avoids extra wrappers in HTML (`<div>` pollution).
- Improves DOM cleanliness and styling.
- Slight performance benefits (fewer DOM nodes).

### Syntax:

Two ways to use:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function List() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
      <li>Mango</li>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

Short syntax:

```jsx
function List() {
  return (
    <>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
      <li>Mango</li>
    </>
  );
}
```

## StrictMode

### Definition:

StrictMode is a development tool that helps identify potential problems in an application.
It doesn't render anything visible and only runs in development mode (has no effect in production).

### What it does:

- Detects unsafe lifecycle methods.
- Warns about deprecated APIs.
- Highlights unexpected side effects by intentionally running some functions twice (in dev).
- Encourages following best practices.

### Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

**Important:** If you see certain hooks or effects running twice in development, it's often because of StrictMode.

## Suspense

### Definition:

Suspense is a component that lets you display a fallback UI (like a loader) while waiting for some code or data to load.

Originally introduced for code-splitting with `React.lazy()`, and now also used for data fetching in newer React features.

### Use cases:

- Lazy loading components
- Coordinating asynchronous loading states

### Example (with React.lazy):

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

Here:

- While `MyComponent` is being loaded (network request), `<h2>Loading...</h2>` is shown.
- Once loaded, it replaces the fallback.

## Quick Recap Table:

| Feature    | Purpose                                                  | Runs in Production? | Typical Use             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fragment   | Group elements without extra DOM nodes                   | Yes                 | Avoid `<div>` wrappers  |
| StrictMode | Highlight potential issues in dev                        | No                  | Detect bad practices    |
| Suspense   | Show fallback while waiting for lazy-loaded code or data | Yes                 | Lazy loading, async UIs |

# Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

## Controlled Components

A **Controlled Component** is a form input whose value is controlled by React state.

- The source of truth is the React state, not the DOM.
- You update the value via setState (or useState) and pass it as value to the input.
- Every change triggers an event handler (onChange) that updates the state.

### Example – Controlled Component

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function ControlledExample() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value); // React state updates
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Submitted Name:", name);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={name} // controlled by React
        onChange={handleChange} 
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default ControlledExample;
```

**Key points:**
- React always knows the current value.
- Easier to validate and manipulate in real-time.
- More code but predictable.

## Uncontrolled Components

An **Uncontrolled Component** is a form input that keeps its own state in the DOM instead of React state.

- The source of truth is the DOM, not React.
- You use a ref to directly read the value from the DOM when needed.

### Example – Uncontrolled Component

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledExample() { 
  const nameRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (event) => { 
    event.preventDefault(); 
    console.log("Submitted Name:", nameRef.current.value); // read from DOM 
  };

  return ( 
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={nameRef} /> {/* DOM manages value */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledExample;
```

**Key points:**
- React doesn't track value changes in real-time.
- Less code but harder to validate dynamically.
- Closer to traditional HTML form handling.

## Difference Between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components

| Feature | Controlled Component | Uncontrolled Component |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Data source | React state | DOM (via refs) |
| Value access | state variable | ref.current.value |
| Change handling | onChange updates state | No state update, changes happen in DOM |
| Validation | Easy (real-time in onChange) | Harder (need to manually read from DOM) |
| Code verbosity | More verbose | Less verbose |
| Use case | Dynamic forms, instant validation, UI sync | Simple forms, integrating non-React libraries |

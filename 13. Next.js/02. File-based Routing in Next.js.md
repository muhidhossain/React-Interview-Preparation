## File-based Routing in Next.js

### What is File-based Routing?

In Next.js, the file structure inside the `pages/` directory defines your app’s routes automatically — no need to manually configure a router like in React Router.

Each file’s path corresponds directly to a URL path.

**Example:** `pages/about.js` → `/about`

Nested folders become nested routes: `pages/blog/post.js` → `/blog/post`

---

### How it Works

Next.js scans the `pages/` directory at build time and creates routes based on:

- File name → URL
- Folder structure → Nested paths

When you add or rename a file in `pages/`, the route updates automatically.

---

### Special Routing Features

#### A. Dynamic Routes

Files/folders wrapped in square brackets (`[param]`) become dynamic segments.

**Example:**
`pages/blog/[id].js` → `/blog/1`, `/blog/abc`

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;
  return <h1>Blog Post {id}</h1>;
}
```

---

#### B. Catch-all Routes

`pages/docs/[...slug].js` → Matches `/docs/a`, `/docs/a/b`, `/docs/a/b/c`

The `slug` param becomes an array of segments.

---

#### C. Index Routes

`pages/index.js` → `/`
`pages/blog/index.js` → `/blog`

---

#### D. Special Files

- `_app.js` → Custom App component for global layout/styles.
- `_document.js` → Custom HTML document structure.
- `_error.js` → Custom error page.

---

#### E. API Routes

Any file inside `pages/api/` becomes an API endpoint.

**Example:** `pages/api/hello.js` → `/api/hello`

```js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello API' });
}
```

---

### Benefits

- No manual route configuration.
- Predictable — folder structure matches URL structure.
- Supports static & dynamic routes easily.
- API routes co-exist with page routes in the same project.

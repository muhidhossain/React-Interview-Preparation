## Container vs Presentational Components

### What They Are

This is a design pattern in React used to separate UI concerns from data & logic concerns.

---

### Presentational Components

**Focus:** How things look.

**Role:**

- Render UI.
- Receive all data and callbacks via props.
- Contain little to no business logic.

**Characteristics:**

- Usually functional components.
- No direct API calls or Redux connections.
- Often reusable across different contexts.

**Example:**

```jsx
function UserList({ users }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((u) => (
        <li key={u.id}>{u.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### Container Components

**Focus:** How things work.

**Role:**

- Handle data fetching, state management, and business logic.
- Pass data and event handlers down to Presentational Components.

**Characteristics:**

- Often connected to Redux, API calls, or hooks.
- Usually have less reusable UI.

**Example:**

```jsx
function UserListContainer() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users')
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setUsers);
  }, []);
  return <UserList users={users} />;
}
```

### Benefits of the Pattern

- **Separation of Concerns** → UI and logic evolve independently.
- **Reusability** → Presentational components can be reused with different containers.
- **Testability** → You can test UI and logic separately.

### Modern React Notes

With Hooks and custom hooks, we can still achieve this separation without strictly splitting into two files.

**Example:** Keep UI in a component, and move data logic into a `useUsers()` hook.

The strict "container/presentational" terminology is less common now, but the principle is still widely used.

### Interview Soundbite

> “Container components focus on how things work (data fetching, state, business logic), while Presentational components focus on how things look (rendering UI). Separating them improves reusability, testability, and maintainability. Even though hooks have blurred the lines, the principle of keeping UI and logic concerns separate still applies.”

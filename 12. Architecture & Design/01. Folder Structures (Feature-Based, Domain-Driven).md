## Folder Structures (Feature-Based, Domain-Driven)

### Why Folder Structure Matters

**Purpose:** Organizing files in a scalable way so the project stays maintainable as it grows.

A good structure reduces coupling, improves discoverability, and helps new devs onboard faster.

In React, two popular approaches are:

- Feature-based structure
- Domain-driven structure (a variation of feature-based but more business-oriented)

### Feature-Based Folder Structure

**Definition:**
Group files by feature or functionality, not by file type.
Each feature has its own folder containing everything related to it (components, hooks, tests, styles, etc.).

**Example:**

```text
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   └── LoginForm.jsx
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   └── useAuth.js
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── authApi.js
│   │   ├── authSlice.js
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── dashboard/
│       ├── components/
│       │   ├── DashboardHeader.jsx
│       │   └── DashboardStats.jsx
│       ├── services/
│       │   └── dashboardApi.js
│       └── dashboardSlice.js
├── common/
│   └── components/
│       ├── Button.jsx
│       └── Modal.jsx
├── App.jsx
└── index.js
```

**Pros:**

- Keeps related logic together → easy to find things.
- Encourages reusability inside a feature.
- Makes removing or adding features easier.

**Cons:**

- Might duplicate some utilities between features (if not careful).
- Could lead to inconsistent structure if each feature is organized differently.

**When to use:**

- Mid-to-large apps with multiple independent features.
- Teams that iterate on features separately.

### Domain-Driven Folder Structure

**Definition:**
A more business-oriented version of feature-based structure.
"Domain" = a business area (e.g., Payments, Orders, Users).
Often aligns with DDD (Domain-Driven Design) concepts from backend systems.

**Example:**

```text
src/
├── domains/
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── UserList.jsx
│   │   │   └── UserProfile.jsx
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── userApi.js
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   └── useUserData.js
│   │   └── store/
│   │       └── userSlice.js
│   └── orders/
│       ├── components/
│       │   ├── OrderList.jsx
│       │   └── OrderDetails.jsx
│       ├── services/
│       │   └── orderApi.js
│       └── store/
│           └── orderSlice.js
├── shared/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Navbar.jsx
│   │   └── Footer.jsx
│   └── utils/
│       ├── formatDate.js
│       └── apiClient.js
├── App.jsx
```

**Key difference from feature-based:**

- Feature-based focuses on UI functionality (e.g., Dashboard, Auth).
- Domain-driven focuses on business domains (e.g., Users, Orders, Products).

**Pros:**

- Matches the mental model of business stakeholders.
- Easier to map frontend work to backend APIs/services.
- Works well for microfrontend architectures.

**Cons:**

- Can feel heavy-handed for small projects.
- Requires clear understanding of business boundaries.

**When to use:**

- Enterprise-level apps.
- Projects with complex business rules.
- Teams that work closely with backend services.

### Hybrid Approach (Common in Real Projects)

Many teams blend the two:

```text
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   └── dashboard/
├── domains/
│   ├── users/
│   └── orders/
├── shared/
│   ├── components/
│   └── utils/
```

This way, you can:

- Keep business-critical logic in domains.
- Keep cross-cutting app functionality in features.
- Keep reusable things in shared.

### Interview Tips

If asked, explain why you’d choose a certain structure:

- Feature-based → best for UI-heavy, modular frontends.
- Domain-driven → best for enterprise, business-focused projects.
- Show you understand scalability and maintainability.
- Mention you’d document the folder structure so all devs follow the same pattern.

## Component Reuse & Separation of Concerns

### Component Reuse in React

**Definition:**
Creating components in a way that they can be used in multiple places without duplicating code.
In React, reusable components are often generic, configurable, and decoupled from specific contexts.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Reusable Button
export default function Button({ variant = "primary", children, ...props }) {
	return (
		<button className={`btn btn-${variant}`} {...props}>
			{children}
		</button>
	);
}

// Usage
<Button variant="primary">Save</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
```

**Key principles for reusability:**

- Props for customization (e.g., text, styles, behavior).
- Avoid hardcoding business logic — make it configurable.
- Composition over inheritance — let parent pass children or components.
- Encapsulate styles — prevent external CSS from breaking it.

**Benefits:**

- Less code duplication → easier maintenance.
- Consistent look and feel.
- Faster development for new features.

**Trade-offs:**

- Over-generalizing can make components too abstract and hard to understand.
- Sometimes better to keep it specific and refactor later if reuse is needed.

### Separation of Concerns (SoC) in React

**Definition:**
Dividing a system into distinct parts, each responsible for a single purpose, so that changes in one area have minimal effect on others.

In React, this often means:

- UI logic is separate from business logic.
- Components are split into presentational (UI-focused) and container (state/data-fetching) roles.
- Hooks are used to isolate stateful logic from UI.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Hook for data fetching (logic concern)
function useUsers() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/users')
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setUsers);
  }, []);
  return users;
}

// UI component (presentation concern)
function UserList() {
  const users = useUsers();
  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((u) => (
        <li key={u.id}>{u.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Easier to test (logic and UI tested separately).
- Better reusability (logic hooks can be reused in multiple UIs).
- Clearer codebase structure.

**Common SoC patterns in React:**

- **Container & Presentational Components**
  - Container: handles data fetching, state.
  - Presentational: focuses on rendering UI.
- **Custom Hooks**
  - Extracts stateful/business logic from components.
- **Service Layer**
  - API calls and business logic kept separate from components.

### Interview Pointers

If they ask:

**“How do you ensure reusability in components?”**
→ Mention props, composition, avoiding hardcoding, generic styling, and isolating concerns.

**“How do you apply Separation of Concerns in React?”**
→ Talk about custom hooks, container/presentational split, and service layers.

**Bonus:** Mention that SoC also improves team collaboration because UI devs and logic devs can work independently.

## üéØ Interview Tips

### Key areas (what interviewers expect)

- Core React: hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo/useCallback) and lifecycle equivalents
- Component design: composition, single-responsibility, controlled vs uncontrolled patterns
- Performance: memoization, virtualization, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, code-splitting
- State management: Context API, Redux/Toolkit, and modern lightweight stores (Zustand, Recoil)
- Routing & Next.js: client vs server rendering, file-based routing, App Router basics, API routes
- Data fetching: REST vs GraphQL, React Query/SWR, caching, pagination, and error/loading states
- Testing: unit/component/integration testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and MSW
- TypeScript: typing props, generics, discriminated unions, and utility types
- Soft skills & design: communicating trade-offs, writing clear PRs, and system-design basics for frontends

### Study strategy (how to practice)

1. Read the core topics in this repo in order: Core React ‚Üí State Management ‚Üí Routing ‚Üí API Integrations ‚Üí Testing.
2. Build 2‚Äì3 small focused apps that exercise multiple areas (e.g., a CRUD app with forms, client-side caching, and tests).
3. Add performance improvements iteratively: measure with React DevTools Profiler, then apply memoization or virtualization where needed.
4. Write tests for critical flows: unit tests for utils/hooks, component tests for UI, and integration tests for page-level flows using MSW.
5. Practice explaining trade-offs out loud: five-minute explanations of choices (e.g., Redux vs Context, SSR vs CSR).

### Practical checklist (ready-to-show answers/code)

- [ ] Explain useEffect with dependency arrays and common pitfalls (stale closures, missing deps)
- [ ] Demonstrate controlled vs uncontrolled inputs and when to use each
- [ ] Describe memoization patterns (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) and when they're beneficial
- [ ] Compare state management options and pick one for a given scenario (justify choice)
- [ ] Show a small data-fetching example using React Query or SWR with caching and error handling
- [ ] Write a component test with React Testing Library and a mocked API using MSW
- [ ] Type a small component with generics or utility types and explain the trade-offs
- [ ] Walk through a simple frontend system-design diagram for a scalable React app (data flow, caching layer, state boundaries)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

1. Pick a learning path: follow the Table of Contents in order (Core React ‚Üí State Management ‚Üí Routing ‚Üí API Integrations ‚Üí Testing).
2. For each topic, open the linked markdown file, read the explanation, run any example code locally, then try the short exercises.
3. Build small projects that combine topics (e.g., a Next.js CRUD app that uses React Query, Redux or Zustand, and has unit + integration tests).
4. Use the Practical checklist above to create small, demonstrable artifacts you can show in interviews (code snippets, tests, design diagrams).
5. Add your notes or corrections directly into the topic files ‚Äî filenames contain spaces, so use your editor's file open dialog or click links from this README.

## üìù Notes

- This repository uses modern React (functional components + hooks).
- Files are organized by topic folders; links in this README are percent-encoded to work with filenames that contain spaces and special characters.
- If you prefer, rename files to simpler names (no spaces) and update links here ‚Äî I can do that automatically if you want.
- Contributions, issues, and PRs are welcome ‚Äî follow standard GitHub flow (fork ‚Üí branch ‚Üí PR) and include short descriptions of any added examples or corrections.

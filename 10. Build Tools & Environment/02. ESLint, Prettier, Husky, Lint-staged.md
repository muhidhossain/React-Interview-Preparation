## ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-staged

### ESLint

**What it is:**
A static code analysis tool that identifies problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
Helps enforce code quality and coding style by following configurable rules.

**Key points for interview:**

- Works with plugins like eslint-plugin-react or @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin.
- Can enforce best practices (e.g., no unused variables, consistent prop-types, accessibility checks).
- Supports custom rules and configs (.eslintrc.json, .eslintrc.js).
- Integrates with IDEs to show errors in real time.

**Example:**

```bash
npm install eslint eslint-plugin-react --save-dev
```

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:react/recommended'],
  rules: {
    'no-unused-vars': 'warn',
    'react/prop-types': 'off',
  },
};
```

**Interview tip:** ESLint is about finding and preventing bugs & enforcing rules.

### Prettier

**What it is:**
An opinionated code formatter that automatically formats your code according to consistent style rules.

**Key points for interview:**

- Removes debates over code style in teams.
- Supports JS, TS, CSS, HTML, Markdown, JSON, etc.
- Works alongside ESLint — but ESLint checks, Prettier formats.
- Configurable with .prettierrc.

**Example:**

```bash
npm install prettier --save-dev
```

```json
// .prettierrc
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "semi": false,
  "printWidth": 80
}
```

**Interview tip:** Prettier ensures code looks the same regardless of who writes it.

---

### Husky

**What it is:**
A tool for managing Git hooks in your project.
Lets you run scripts before commits, pushes, merges, etc.

**Key points for interview:**

- Commonly used to prevent bad code from being committed.
- Works with ESLint and Prettier to enforce quality before commits.

**Example:**

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm test"
```

Now, every git commit runs tests before proceeding.

**Interview tip:** Husky is about automation & enforcing standards at commit time.

### lint-staged

**What it is:**
A tool that runs linters only on staged files in Git.

**Key points for interview:**

- Works with Husky to avoid checking the entire codebase every commit.
- Speeds up pre-commit checks.
- Can run ESLint, Prettier, tests, etc., only for changed files.

**Example:**

```bash
npm install lint-staged --save-dev
```

```json
// package.json
"lint-staged": {
	"*.js": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]
}
```

**Interview tip:** lint-staged is about efficiency — only checking what's changed.

### How They Work Together in a React Project

- **ESLint** — Detects & warns about code quality issues.
- **Prettier** — Formats code consistently.
- **lint-staged** — Runs ESLint & Prettier only on staged files.
- **Husky** — Runs lint-staged before committing via Git hooks.

**Flow example:**
Write code → Stage files → Husky runs pre-commit → lint-staged runs ESLint + Prettier on changed files → Commit only if clean.

### Quick Interview Script (30–40s answer)

ESLint is for finding and preventing bugs with customizable rules.
Prettier is for automatic code formatting so the code style stays consistent.
Husky lets us run Git hooks to enforce rules before commits or pushes.
lint-staged runs linters only on staged files for speed.
Together, they ensure clean, consistent, and error-free code before it even gets into the repository.
